# Express and React Boilerplate with Auth

A simple boilerplat that contains the following:
- express
- react
- jest
- knex
- bookshelf
- passport local

## Getting started:

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i`
- `cd backend/db && npx knex migrate:latest`
- `npm run dev`

## Deployment Notes

This repo could be deployed by itself to Heroku. But it's more ideal to deploy the front end's result (the public folder) on a faster CDN like github.
